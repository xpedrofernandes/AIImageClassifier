# AIImageClassifier
Description
Project consists on an AI-powered web application in Python using TensorFlow (MobileNetV2), Streamlit, and OpenCV to automatically identify objects in uploaded photos.The system preprocesses images for accuracy and then provides the top three predictions with confidence levels through a clean, user-friendly interface. To ensure responsiveness, I optimized the app with efficient image handling and model caching, resulting in a smooth and reliable user experience.

Languages and Utilities Used:
Python
TensorFlow (MobileNetV2)
Streamlit
OpenCV
